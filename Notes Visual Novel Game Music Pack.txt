Hello Developpers and games makers!

We are C.M.A.F.V.G. (Communauty Music Assets For Video Games) a communauty of 3 persons (for now, we hope to make it bigger) of composers/sound designers passionnate by vidéogame.
We strongly believe in music assets of quality and flexibility at the same level, what that means : We try to make great musics most natural as possible with orchestrations or arrangments
AND great options of loops/adaptative/interractions/stems (multi instruments).

This time it's a second of four next albums only composed by me Rafdows that will come each next 2 week (and so one one week ago) and after this one (so yes, a next one come this next week),
here it's so Visual Novel Game Music Pack, Inspirated by Visual Novel, Point & Click, Adventure Game, etc...
Last week it was Aliens VS Space Soldiers Game Music Pack, an OST in the spirit of Science-Fiction games, exploration, action, shooter,...

Next one an ost about horror/thriller/creepy/spychological and finaly a classical ost about (Week 3)
RPG/JRPG/Epic/great adventure Adventure about hero... (Week 4)

So this one is inspirated essentially Visual Novel and Manga story style, narative game, deep story, strong character, Adventure Game where the Story is more important than the game,
Point & Click with a lot of event and twist, etc...

Ten tracks slice in loops and sometime bridges to help transitions, so yes with good possiblity of interaction and low price because only 18:22 of music,
In Wav, 24 bits, 44,1 kHz stereo, size : 371 Mo, compatibility on Windows as Mac.

We hope you'll really enjoy theses musics!

Off course, if you want a real custom work, we are availlable that for also!

Feel free to ask me questions, I'll answer them as best I can!!
Thanks to have purchased this pack, we hope you'll have great using about it!
Nice regards,

Rafdows
